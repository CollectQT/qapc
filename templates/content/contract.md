**Confirming Talent and Associates**


After a person contacts QAPC an organizer will put them on the list of people to contact.

1. There will be a sit down meeting to get to know the performers and to explain that porn lasts a lifetime, if they are not already in porn. In this meeting the performer will be able to discuss what they want their role in QAPC to be. This also gives everyone a chance to see if the performer would be a good fit in the collective.

2. QAPC encourages all performers to come up with shoot ideas that they would like to be apart of and with whom they would want work with.

3. All performers are required to give organizers a photo of their ID, and send STD test results 2 weeks before shooting. This information will be put in the performers folder as required by law.

QAPC encourages that staff do not opt of the PIR.  QAPC will reimburse staff for one time use items. (that is: the videographer should not be bringing their own collection of condoms to every shoot)

2. If / when staff want to use something for the production, they should let the QAPC buy it from them.
