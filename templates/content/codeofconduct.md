**The Quick Version**


QAPC strives to provide a harassment-free workplace regardless of gender, age, disability, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff or contractors in any form. All workers violating these rules may be disciplined or expelled from QAPC at the discretion of the organizers.

**The Less Quick Version**


1. Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, body size, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording without permission, sustained disruption of work, unwelcome physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.


2. Alcohol and drug use on sets are restricted to local and federal laws and regulations.


3. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.


4. If a worker engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action that the collective deems appropriate. This may include but not limited to a warning that includes a meeting with at least two staff. 

5. Any activity, or language consented to during a shoot should never be assumed to be consented to outside of the shoot. 

6. At a baseline there should never be an assumption of consent, regardless of previous interactions and behavior. 

7. No response to a message, call, email, question, or a lack of a positive response is non consent.

8. If a worker is harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff or security immediately.  

9. If it was a staff member or security who was the perpetrator of inappropriate behavior then contact any other member you trust. 

10. When contacting staff or security you trust about an incident, include another person outside of the organization that you trust. 


11. Staff and security will be happy to help any worker through contacting an advocate or organization the worker feels comfortable with. We will provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the shoot.


12. When outside of QAPC and see another worker do not call them by any names or gendered pronouns unless they have told you a specific name and pronoun. (example for gender neutral pronouns: they/them/their)

12. QAPC understands that not all people may be out about their job as a sex worker or their gender. We understand not calling workers any names or pronouns without their explicit permission is the best way to keep everyone safe.


12. Don't touch people, their mobility devices, other assistive equipment, and general property without their consent. 

12. If a worker asks you to stop a certain behavior, stop right away.


12. Workers are free from judgement or exclusion for their stated hard limits, refusal to perform, or physical/emotional capability to perform certain acts or scenarios. 


12. Time for aftercare for performers will be available after the conclusion of filming a scene.


12. We expect workers to follow these rules at any shoot, meeting and collective-related social events.


12. All staff, contractors,  and performers are required to abide by the code of conduct. Security and organizers will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all workers to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.
