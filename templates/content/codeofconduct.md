The Quick Version
QAP Collective is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of staff or contractors in any form. Staff or contractors violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from QAPC without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.

The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording without permission, sustained disruption of work, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Alcohol and drug use on sets are restricted to local and federal laws and regulations.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action that the collective deems appropriate including but not limited to a first and only warning that includes a sit down meeting with at least two staff members. If said behavior or other incidents arise then person in question is expected to seek counseling (we will refer to possible therapeutic resources but not act as a social worker in seeking help for individuals) on a self motivated basis. After a year of counseling and work on part of said individual, the case may be revisited as the collective believes that humans can fundamentally change their behavior and belief systems. It is not QAPC’s job to rehabilitate an individual, merely strive to uphold the standards we have set as a collective.
Any activity, scene, behavior, language or dialogue consented to during a shoot should never be assumed to be consented to outside of the shoot. At a baseline there should never be an assumption of consent, regardless of context or previous interactions and behavior. No response to a message, call, email, question or inquiry or lack of positive response should be assumed as non consent.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff or security immediately.  If it was a staff member or security who was the perpetrator of inappropriate behavior then contact any other member you trust. When contacting the staff or security member you trust about an incident or problem it’s best to include another person outside of the organization that you trust in the correspondence.
Staff and security will be happy to help any performer, contractor, or staff member to contact an advocate or organization the victim feels comfortable with dealing with the incident,  provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the shoot.
If you see someone outside of a shoot and want to talk to them do not call them by any names or gendered pronouns unless they have told you that a specific name and pronouns (example for gender neutral pronouns: they/them/their) are okay in a public context before interacting with them in public. It is understood within QAPC that not all people may be out about their jobs as a sex worker or their gender and refraining from calling them any names or pronouns without their explicit permission is the best way to keep everyone safe.
Don't touch people, their mobility devices, other assistive equipment, and general property that they bring onto set or to meetings without their consent. If someone asks you to stop a certain behavior, cease immediately.
Performers are free from judgement or exclusion for their stated hard limits, refusal to perform, or physical or emotional capability to perform certain acts or scenarios. Likewise for stated personal proclivities or desires.
A check-in and availability for aftercare for performers will be made available after the conclusion of filming a scene.
We expect participants to follow these rules at any shoot, meeting and collective-related social events.
