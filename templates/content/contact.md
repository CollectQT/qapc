# Contacting Us

Hi everyone! We're looking for new faces to join us. Any inquiries please email us at <qapcollective@gmail.com>.

When working with QAPC you do not always have to wait for us to contact you to start a shoot. Have a scene idea, a location you want to film, or a specific person (partner, friend, someone you know who already shoots pornography)? Let us know so we can start planning the shoot with you!

QAPC wants to bring the power back to the performers and through that we want your input for the scenes you are in. If you want to come up with the scene idea, the script, the location, and the performers and all we do is do the filming, editing, and advertising for you, we are for it. By contacting us we will put you in our list of workers that we will contact if we feel you fit a specific shoot, but please do not wait for us to come up with ideas. Get creative, have fun, love your work. We know we will.

Please send us an email with the following information:

---

* **Your name** (stage name or otherwise)


* **Age**


* **Your general location**


* **Tell us whether you have done porn, or any other type of sex work** (this is just to give us an idea of your experience)


* **Any pictures of yourself or links to pictures** (they do not need to be professional, nude, or full body. This is just so we can put a face to a name)


* **Any social media account you have that you think is relevant** (twitter /tumblr / fetlife / etc)


* **Type of shoot you would be interested in** (If you donâ€™t current have any ideas, don't worry about it!)


* **Any other information that you feel is relevant or any questions you may have**
