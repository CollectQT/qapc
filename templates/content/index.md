# (Q)ueer (A)rt and (P)orn (C)ollective

**We shoot trade porn for sex workers**


QAPC's goal is to work on the problems in porn that happen because of capitalism. We can not prevent all problems but we can try to create a safer space for people on set as we create fresh, hot content. QAPC hopes to help the porn industry by setting a higher standard for conduct. We are doing this through our Code of Conduct that we hold to everyone that works with us to the best of our ability.


Capitalism fills us all with beliefs that hurt others and ourselves. Racism, misogyny, transphobia, islamophobia, anti semitism, fatphobia, etc., make up our society and media. We created QAPC because many of us have worked in abusive situations as sex workers and non sex workers. QAPC's work may not protect us from the harms of capitalism, but we hope that we can at least create a more positive work place.


Also we love making gay as fuck porn.
